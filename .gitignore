  Ready to plan the build? Say
   the word and I'll design   
  the full implementation plan
   — routes, data models, API 
  layer, and component        
  structure — before writing a
   single line of code.

  Verify it's live

  After deploy, hit all 5     
  URLs:

  https://calltone.ai/dental  
  https://calltone.ai/hvac    
  https://calltone.ai/medspa  
  https://calltone.ai/law     
  https://calltone.ai/consulti
  ng

  If you get a 404, the deploy
   hasn't finished yet — wait 
  60 seconds and refresh.

❯ Do i need to signin         
  first before i can          
  access landing page?        

● No. The landing pages are     fully public — no sign-in
  required.                   
  
  They live under               src/app/(marketing)/ which  
  uses the marketing layout
  (MarketingHeader +
  MarketingFooter), completely
   separate from the
  authenticated dashboard     
  routes.

  Anyone with the link can    
  open it directly in a       
  browser — including LinkedIn
   ad traffic hitting the     
  pages cold. That's the      
  intended behaviour for a    
  landing page campaign.
