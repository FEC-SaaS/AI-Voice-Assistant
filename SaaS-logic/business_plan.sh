## Pricing Strategy

### Value-Based Pricing Logic

```
Customer Value Calculation:

Average receptionist salary: $40,000/year = $3,333/month
Our Professional plan: $299/month

Customer saves: $3,034/month (91% reduction)
Our price = 9% of value delivered

This is the "no-brainer" pricing sweet spot.
```

### Pricing Psychology

1. **Anchor High** - Show enterprise pricing first
2. **Popular Plan** - Highlight Professional as "Most Popular"
3. **Annual Discount** - 20% off for annual payment
4. **No Hidden Fees** - All-inclusive pricing builds trust

├── Infrastructure: $15 (4%)
├── Support: $25 (7%)
├── Payment processing: $10 (3%)
└── Total COGS: $120 (34%)

Gross Profit: $230 (66% margin)
